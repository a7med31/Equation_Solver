# Equation Solver and Plotter

This is a Python GUI application built using PySide2 and Matplotlib. It allows users to input two mathematical functions of x, solves for their intersection points, and plots the functions with the solution points highlighted.

## Features
  **Input Functions:** Accepts two functions of x from the user.
  
  **Supported Operators:** +, -, /, *, ^, log10(), sqrt().
  
  **Solve Equations:** Finds the intersection points of the two functions.
  
  **Plot Functions:** Plots the functions and highlights the solution points.
  
  **Input Validation:** Ensures the input functions are valid and displays error messages for invalid input.
